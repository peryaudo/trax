####GAME 1:
Trax
  1 @0/  
  2 A2+  
  3 A3/   ;This is one of my favourite openings. Black has almost nothing, while 
          ; white has 2 corners. Also the obvious moves A0/ (or A4/) and @1/ (or 
          ; B3/) are fatal:
          ;A0/ B1/ any @4/ any A1\ any win
          ;@1/ B0/ any @4/ any A1\ any win
  4 @2/   ;Safe move
  5 @2/   ;Creating an L threat - just checking where you are at.
          ;A1\  any  win
  6 A1/   ;Defends the L
  7 D2+   ;Starting to set up a horizontal line, but keeping my options open.
  8 B0+   ;Defends the early line threat and extends the black line
  9 @3+   ;Kills your corner. Also the 2 white line segments on the left can be 
          ; linked up later to make an attack. I am setting up for 11 C0/, 
          ; giving 2 back to back Ls (E1/ and B1\ give 2 attacks each). In 
          ; Supertrax, such a position is undefendable, but in regular Trax it 
          ; can be run out of space.
 10 D0/   ;Prevents my C0/, but is fatal.
 11 E1/  
 12 F1/   ;My counter-attack, and your defence.
 13 D0\   ;Attacking into a hollow has limited defences. Either defence 
          ; (C1\ or C2+) in this case gives me an L.
 14 C1\  
 15 B1+   ;Which I activate, giving myself 2 attacks, of which you can 
          ; only defend one.
 16 E0+   ;A desperate attempt to side track me by counter-attacking one of my 
          ; attacks. This sometimes works against weaker players across the 
          ; table!
 17 @5/   ;However, I ignore it and complete my loop.

One observation - in this game the only attack you made (10 D0/) turned out to be fatal. Although that is not always the case, in general attacking without good reason usually weakens your position (it uses up a corner - your attacking potential) and often gives your opponent potential (either directly as in this case, or in the defence). You will notice that although I made a couple of threats, I did not make an attack until I could see that it would be to my advantage. It this case, it was the start of a 4 stage win (moves 11, 13, 15, and 17).

####GAME 2:
Trax
  1 @0+  
  2 B1+   ;Since you played a straight, I decided to see what I could do with 
          ; a line game. I extended my line. Note that although it is not 
          ; dangerous at this stage, it is threatening, and can grow longer 
          ; quite quickly.
  3 A0/   ;The attack across the line is quite safe - I know good players who
          ; like this move. However, I never use it myself. Just personal 
          ; preference - I don't like attacking too early.
  4 A3/   ;Defends the attack. Note that white has nothing while black has 
          ; three corners.
  5 @3/   ;Makes a couple of corners. This also extends my line, making it 
          ; stronger.
  6 @3+   ;I kill one of your new corners while extending my line. This gives me 
          ; an L in the top left corner (A1\ gives two attacks)
  7 B1+   ;A conventional defence of the L. It also brings out a parallel black 
          ; line which will make defending the line easier
  8 @3+   ;To avoid turning the line back, I extend it out a little further. Now 
          ; the line is starting to become dangerous. Note that it was not 
          ; strictly necessary to extend my line out to prevent it from being 
          ; turned back. If I played somewhere else, and you linked it back, you 
          ; would lose as follows:
          ;8 @2/ A0\ any E1/ any win.
          ;Your turning the line back would give me an edge (3 stage threat).
  9 E3+   ;An attack
 10 D4\   ;I defend giving myself a 3 stage threat known as a short edge:
          ;C5/ any E5\ any win.
 11 F2\   ;Turns the line back a little. Note that it is still dangerous. It 
          ; also defends my short edge and creates a short L for you
          ;(F4\ gives you two attacks).
 12 G2\   ;I cap off your corners. This kills your L, creates an L for me,
          ;and makes my line very dangerous.
 13 @3\   ;A weak, and ineffective move. It does however kill the L, but does 
          ; nothing for the line - I can straighten my line out again and it is 
          ; one tile longer than before. The best defence of the line would have 
          ; been 13 A1\ any @3+. This also runs the L out of space. Linking back 
          ; my line is now safe with the other end turned down(from move 11).
 14 A2\   ;I straighten my line out. It is now impossible for you to prevent me 
          ; from getting the other end home.
 15 G4\   ;The best move that you had available. Partially turns my line around 
          ; and creates an attack.
 16 G5\   ;I defend the attack by straightening out my line. It is now only one 
          ; turn away.
 17 E5+   ;Defends the L threat which was also created.
 18 H5+   ;However, I get the line home to win.

####GAME 3:
Trax
  1 @0+  
  2 @1+   ;This is the start of an early line game. Although not dangerous at 
          ; this early stage, if left for too long, black can develop a very 
          ; strong line.
  3 C1\   ;My standard response to such a position. This move doesn't actually 
          ; defend the line, but it allows me to defend it later.
  4 C2\   ;As you can see, you can straighten out your line, making it one tile
          ; longer.
  5 B3\   ;This position is known as Smith's opening, after David Smith who 
          ; first analysed it in any depth. It is strong for three reasons.
          ;1) it kills the black corner, replacing it with a white corner. Black 
          ; now has no opportunities for making a direct attack.
          ;2) It prevents the black line from being extended to the left. If 
          ; 6 @1+, white responds with B3/ creating two attacks. Such a position 
          ; is called a pair L since the attack at the bottom of the L creates a 
          ; connectable pair.
          ;3) It prevents the black line from being extended to the right. If
          ;
          ;6 D2+ B0/ C4+ C5\ D4\ E4\ any E1/ any win
          ;                  D5\ E6\ any B6/ any win
          ;          D4\ E4\ any E1/ any win
          ;Note that the black line has not actually been defended - just 
          ; temporarily delayed.
  6 D2+   ;This move extends the black line to the right, setting up the 5 stage 
          ; threat for white. More usual replies (if you want to keep the line 
          ; threat) are A3+, B4\ or A0/.
  7 B0/   ;The way this threat works is that I attack into the hollow in the 
          ; bottom right corner. Attacking into such a hollow is generally 
          ; strong since the attack can only be defended downwards and to the 
          ; right. In this case, such defences set up an edge threat on the 
          ; right hand side for me.
  8 C4+   ;Of your two choices, this is the better since it makes me work for an 
          ; extra turn to get my win. In other words it gives me more chances to 
          ; change my mind or make a mistake.
  9 C5\   ;I reform the attack, again into a hollow. Again it can only be 
          ; defended to the right or downwards.
 10 D4\   ;Either defence gives me an edge along the right hand side
 11 E4\  
 12 D5+   ;which I activate to win.

####GAME 4:
Trax
  1 @0+  
  2 B1+  
  3 C1\  
  4 C2\   ;This game is starting out like the last game. It is a line game with 
          ; Black having a three long line.
  5 C3+   ;White kills black's only corner, bringing out a parallel line. It 
          ; also makes his own line 3 long. However, it doesn't retain the 
          ; initiative, allowing black to extend the line. A much stronger move 
          ; is the single tile B3\, giving Smith's opening (see previous 
          ; commentary)
  6 D2+   ;My line is extended to 4 tiles long. If we had a line race (with each 
          ; of us pushing our lines) I would win since I am one tile in front.
  7 B0/   ;White realises this and turns his own line back, giving a 4 stage 
          ; threat on the right.
          ;E1/ any C6\ D5\ E5\ any win
          ;            D6\ E6+ any win
          ;It also prevents black from extending the line at either end.
          ;If 8 A2+, B4/ any win
          ;If 8 E3+, E4\ any E1/ any win
          ;In spite of these advantages, it is a dangerous move. I was tempted 
          ; to go for a win along the top, hoping you would make a mistake at 
          ; the crucial steps. My corner at B1\ is very strong, facing into a 
          ; hollow. ie
          ;B1\ A1\ E2+ D1/ A0\ any E1/ any win
          ;            E1/ A0\ any F1+ any win
          ;    A2+ A2\ B1\ F2+ E1/ B0\ any E1/ any win
          ;                    F1/ B0\ any F1+ any win
          ;            A1\ F2+ F1/ F0+ any A1+ any win
          ;                    E1/ ...
          ;This last combination you have a counter-attack at each end of my 
          ; edge so I cannot force a win. I would have relied on you picking one 
          ; of the other 5 continuations for a win. My position at the end of 
          ; this is considerably weakened from all my attacking, so I decided 
          ; not to risk it.
          ;A better move would be E1\, even though it allows me to extend my 
          ; line further. It also allows you to turn the line back at the other 
          ; end. ie
          ;E1\ E0+ A4/ any @3+.
  8 B5\   ;Since I can't extend my line, I kill your threat. I do it in such a 
          ; way that it frees both ends of my line, making it very dangerous
          ;
  9 E2\   ;Not a particularly strong move - it allows me to straighten the line 
          ; making it one tile longer. I am not sure what your best move here 
          ; would have been. Your position is quite weak, with only the 1 corner 
          ; in the top left, so none of the obvious things work. I probably 
          ; would have done something like A5+, bringing out a parallel line. 
          ; However, as it stands, the black line cannot be turned back even 
          ; then since it would give an L.
          ;if 9 A5+ @3+ E5\ any win. The move A5+ could be followed up by E2\, 
          ; allowing the line to be turned back in move 13.
 10 D0+   ;I play the obvious and extend my line.
 11 F2/   ;Turning my line towards one of your corners slows it down 
          ; temporarily. However, since the line is so strong, there is little 
          ; else you can do. Turning it to the other corner (F3+) is no better.
 12 G3\   ;I make an attack, providing an extension to my line. This way I am 
          ; hoping to provide a connection to make my line 8 tiles long. Note 
          ; that I could not extend the line at the other end.
          ;if 12 @3+ D0\ C2+ B2\ any win
          ;              C1\ B1+ any win
 13 G4\   ;This was your only move. If you didn't counter-attack, I would win 
          ; with
          ;13 F4+ H2/ H1/  I win with a line
          ;           G1\  I win with the line
          ;           any  H4\ any win  with L
 14 G5\   ;I defend your counter-attack forming an L (H6\). You also have to 
          ; deal with this as well as the line, stretching your resources very 
          ; thin.
 15 B7\   ;Defends the L and gives you a corner which you can use to turn the 
          ; line back. However it also loses the initiative, allowing me to win. 
          ; An unconventional defence such as F6/ would probably have served 
          ; better as it starts giving you somewhere to link the line to. Note 
          ; G6/ is fatal: it loses to A6/ any H2/ any win
          ;with the bottom line.
 16 H5+   ;I make the attack extending the line out.
 17 H1/   ;Your L does not provide enough distraction
 18 G0+   ;I win with the line.

Moves 5 and 7 are weak, and are probably what cost you the game. On their own, either of them was not that bad, but in combination they did little to slow me down, especially after my move 8 (which killed just about everything you had). Move 9 was also weak, but there was virtually nothing else you had. This was a hard game to comment on since your position was weak it was hard to find reasonable alternate moves. I have tried, where possible, to suggest better alternatives. With lines, it is very important to try to get them under control as early as possible.

####GAME 5:

Trax
  1 @0/  
  2 A2+  
  3 A0+   ;My usual move here would have been A3/, but you have already seen 
          ; that opening so I thought I would try something different. Being 
          ; symmetrical, it gives you a slight advantage, but there is nothing 
          ; really here for either player yet.
  4 B1/   ;You make your line into a corner, giving me a corner in the process. 
          ; Your corners are in good positions, but overall the position is 
          ; quite even.
  5 @2+   ;I kill one of your corners, giving myself a corner and connectable 
          ; pair. I have an advantage, but it is your turn so it is pretty even.
  6 C3/   ;You kill my corner, making the position symmetrical. Again there is 
          ; nothing in it, although I have a slight advantage since it is my 
          ; turn.
  7 B4/   ;I destroy the connectable pair, giving myself a corner.
  8 D2+   ;You strengthen your corner, making your line a little longer(still 
          ; quite defendable) and give yourself another corner. This was a good 
          ; move, and had me wondering what to do for a while. I did not like 
          ; your new corner (at D1) but could not destroy it.
          ;If 9 D0\ E2\ any E0/ any B1\ any win  for you
          ;If 9 E1\ C1\ any E0/ any B1\ any win  for you
  9 C0\   ;This prevents you from completing the above threat, and gives me a 
          ; corner near yours. It also strengthens the connectable pair by 
          ; putting one end of it into a hollow.
 10 A1+   ;You see line possibilities. This move makes your line considerably 
          ; stronger since I gain nothing by linking your two segments. In terms 
          ; of corners I have the advantage: 3 corners + a connectable pair to 
          ; your 2. Overall it is still fairly even (with your line balancing my 
          ; extra loop threats), although I have a considerable advantage if I 
          ; can destroy your budding line threat.
 11 E2\   ;I link your line to your corner. My corner there prevents you from 
          ; making your line longer at the moment. I have also set up an L 
          ; threat (E1/).
 12 F2\   ;If you defused the L by linking up, I would kill your horizontal line 
          ; (although it would still be strong vertically). (If 12 D1+ C0+). 
          ; The move you made was good in that it keeps your options open either 
          ; horizontally or vertically. It also destroys two of my corners 
          ; replacing them with your own. It also gives you an L (F4\)
 13 F4/   ;I was contemplating capping off again, giving myself an L, but 
          ; decided on the more subtle F4L. Capping off would have actually made 
          ; your line stronger since you could use the corner at the bottom of 
          ; your L for straightening it out. I have a 4 stage threat along the 
          ; top and right edges:
          ;G4\ any E1+ any G2/ any win
 14 B6/   ;This was the losing move. In what it does it is good - it kills my 
          ; corner, giving you an L. Just based on corners and lines you would 
          ; have a slight advantage. However, this move does not defend the 4 
          ; stage threat. A better move would have been G5/. This has the same 
          ; effect in terms of corners, it defuses my threat, and sets up a 2 
          ; stage cave threat for yourself (F5+ any win). This position is also 
          ; slightly stronger since I can't link the two corners.
 15 G4\   ;I take the initiative, and push forward with my threat.
 16 G5\   ;No defence here matters
 17 C0/   ;I chose to play the variant move here to disguise what I was doing a 
          ; little. E1+ would have been just as effective in this instance.
 18 D1/   ;Again no defence matters. Whatever you play will leave me the L in 
          ; the top right corner.
 19 G1+   ;I activate the L
 20 H2+   ;You defend one of the attacks, making a line counter-attack
 21 F0+   ;but it is one turn too late, and I win the game.

          ; the bottom gives you an L threat (D5\). Although the line looks 
          ; dangerous, you are actually better off leaving it at this stage. 
          ; Your best move at this stage is probably @3\. This prevents me from

          ; but it also makes my line stronger as well. It does nothing to 
          ; defuse my threat since my reply simply reforms it. 
          ;Another move that may have been better is E5\ which kills my threat,

  5 D2/   ;This move kills a black corner, creates a white corner and extends

          ; providing a parallel segment to turn it back to if necessary.
  6 E1+   ;Similarly, this move kills a white corner, creates a black one and 
          ; strengthens blacks aspect ratio advantage. It also threatens a new 
          ; line across the bottom. Another good move is the one you played 
          ; against me in our first game (in the tournament) @1\ which is better 
          ; from a junk path control standpoint, but does create a corner for 
          ; white. I don't know which of the two is better. The @1\ also gives a 
          ; threat, and strengthens the line across the bottom.
  7 @1/   ;This move makes sense, as it creates a corner for you and prevents me 
          ; from turning my long path into a corner.  It also makes it difficult 
          ; for me to turn that path into a line threat as A2/ makes a cave for 
          ; you. I am a bit suspicious of @1/ though, because it makes the

          ;>>I defend your growing line threats by blocking the bottom line.

  8 E0+   ;Move 8 mirrors move seven in that it creates a corner and starts the

          ; extends the position in a direction favourable to the movers'

          ; position in the horizontal direction any further, so I have to start 
          ; taking advantage of the aspect ratio to make lines.
  9 C0/   ;Good move in all respects. It kills a corner, improves your 
          ; connectable pair by making it attack into a hollow, creates a white 
          ; corner and reduces somewhat my aspect ratio advantage. I am now 
          ; concerned that you can play B1/ B0\ A5+ @1\ B0/ threatening a cave

 10 D4+   ;This disrupts the connectable pair that could attack into hollows on

          ; connectable pair.
 11 A4\   ;You turn the line around completely while creating another corner, 
          ; taking advantage of the fact that I, by playing D4+ rather than D3+,

          ; This does raise the possibility of a cave threat by me however.
          ;>>I didn't like the cave, but your line was getting too strong

          ;So I wind up getting some benefit from the weakened line.
 12 B1+   ;I convert a junk path into a corner. I also create another black

 14 B4\   ;I do some junk path control, making a short flat corner and 
          ; resurrecting my line threat. Although this line isn't very long, it

          ;E5+ C5/ A5/ any A2\ any win

 15 D5/   ;You cannot attach the short flat loop to the line without making an

          ; useless since all my attacks would be too far away to do anything 
          ; about your threat.<<
 16 G2\   ;Here I came up with a plan to bring my line around so that it would 
          ; become part of a connectable pair with the former short flat loop. 
          ; I felt if I could do this, I would have a good position as the 
          ; connectable pair could threaten to win with the corner sitting in 
          ; the middle of it. The outer loop of the connectable pair would also 
          ; still be a strong line threat. This first move of the plan threatens 
          ;H2/ any F5+ any H5\ any win.
 17 H2\   ;This defence was expected as it kills the above threat and turns the

          ;>>Again my move was forced. only H2\ and H3+ survive.
          ;D6/ loses to E5+ any G6\ any win

          ; right. I can't counterattack so you would win.<<
 18 G1\   ;This move brings the line around the corner while threatening
          ;D0+ any H1/ any win.
 19 D0/   ;This does defend the above threat, but looking at the position again,

          ; (A2\) and a cave (I1+ any C6+ any win) but it is passive and needed 
          ; the initiative.<<
          ;Perhaps my idea at move 16 was too ambitious.
          ;>>Maybe, but you got it too work, and that is the main thing.<<
          ;Yes, but I was fortunate that I didn't lose my advantage as a result

          ;>>That's what went wrong with my plan at move 19. I had a tenuous

          ; the game (basically from here (move 13) on) responding.<<
 20 H5+   ;I have gotten the position that I was looking for. I believe that the 
          ; defence for you is very difficult if not impossible from here. I

          ;G6+ any win

          ;>>My only move.<<
 22 I5\   ;I kill the cave and setup an L.
          ;>>I was expecting either this or I4/.<<
 23 J5\   ;This seems like a reasonable defence; I don't know if there is

          ;>>In hindsight, G1+, H1\ or I2\ may have been better. I would have

          ; I2/. Any defence I make gives you a win (some quite long). That 
          ; means my move 19 was the losing move.<<
 24 G7/   ;I concede that the horizontal line isn't happening and reform the 
          ; connectable pair. I threaten F6+ and B6\ analogous to move 20 and I

 27 F11+ 
 28 H4+   ;Without move 20, I went for my win, leaving your attack. The game

Looking back, I saw that you feared  B10/ F12+ G11\ I7+
This is probably better than my scenario above. After this, H10+ or @7/ could cause you some anxiety, although at this stage I cannot see how to force a win.

 17 E7+   ;To prevent you from making your counter-attack, I play this move

          ; at it again, I can still win from this by defending with E0/. This 
          ; gives me a line attack, and I still have the L down the bottom.
 18 E8\   ;This defends the L, but allows me to win with the line(G8+ any win).

  4 A0\   ;A full defence.
  5 D1\   ;At this level of play, this is a good move - it creates a white

  8 B5/   ;A good defence. It kills the L, and removes the corner at A4. It also

  9 @5+   ;Extends the white line on the left to prevent it from being turned

 12 C6+   ;Extending the line gains you the advantage in a line race. In fact
